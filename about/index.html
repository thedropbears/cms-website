                    <p>The Mechanical Team is charged with the nuts and bolts of engineering the robot.</p>
                    
                    <p>It provides the opportunity for students to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design, and draw plans for engineering</li>
                        <li>Test designs both physically and theoretically</li>
                        <li>Physically construction of the robot</li>
                        <li>Provide ongoing maintenance of the robot</li>

            <h2>What is FRC?</h2>
            <p>First Robotics Competition (FRC) is a high school robotics competition that is held annually. It is a competition that combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. It is a program that is designed to help students learn more about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to help students develop skills that will help them in the future.</p>
