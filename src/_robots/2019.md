## Overview
The 2019 FIRST Deep Space season tasked teams with manipulating velcro-edged hatch panels and large cargo balls at multiple levels of the rocket and cargo ship. With a clear strategy to “do a few tasks exceptionally,” Banshee was designed around fast ground intake of cargo, station intake of hatch panels, and a powerful endgame climb.

## Strategy & Design

- **Focused Task Selection**  
  Prioritized low-level hatch (velcro discs) and cargo (rubber balls) scoring for rapid cycle times and robot stability.  
- **Intake Station vs. Ground Pickup**  
  Chose ground intake for cargo to maximize autonomy, and station intake for hatch panels to simplify alignment.  
- **Custom Swerve Drive**  
  Leveraged a second-generation swerve module for unmatched agility and defensive maneuverability, driving all four modules with 775pro motors for speed and serviceability.  
- **Endgame Climb**  
  Engineered a dual-leg lift system with pneumatic pistons and lead-screw actuators, achieving a 100% climb success rate in matches where deployed.

## Autonomous Mode

Our autonomous routine took advantage of the hatch mechanisms flexibility and robustness. While this season presented the opportunity to have drivers control their robots using cameras and other sensors during the first 15 seconds, the Drop Bears chose to have the robot autonomously manoeuvre itself and deposit two hatches. We would score the first hatch panel reliably, but the second hatch proved difficult with time constraints. The routine itself was more efficient than many manned robots particularly for the auto climb routine, and won us awards for the unique approach, and the elegance with which it was able to perform the routine.

## Hatch Mechanism

Our hatch mechanism was designed to take advantage of the velcro around the edges of the hatch panel. The idea was to develop a simple, static mechanism which was tolerant to misalignment, allowing the driver to focus on the matter at hand. The mechanism went through a couple of revisions upon discovering that the velcro used rapidly deteriorates, which led to us using a more active mechanism featuring pistons to attach to the inside hole of the hatch. This resulted in an effective, and durable method of manipulating hatches.

## Cargo Mechanism

Our cargo mechanism needed to be able to intake from the ground and deposit to the cargo ship. This meant our mechanism needed to operate at two different heights. The easiest way of doing this was to use a pivoting arm to raise and lower the cargo balls. The arm was powered by a neo motor and was gear driven. To intake the ball itself we used a horizontal roller with mecanum wheels to center the ball. This meant the position of the ball was predictable and the driver could routinely deliver cargo to the cargo ship without having to compensate for misalignment. The cargo mechanism was effective and eventually became our primary source of points, and focus during games.

## Climbing mechanism

Making the robot climb was one of the most difficult tasks we were presented with. We devised a solution which would lift the robot on two legs, drive it forward, and retract each leg as the robot was supported by the platform. The bumpers would hang below the top of the platform, so the robot would deploy three pneumatic pistons to give it the extra height required. The legs were driven by lead screws and neo motors, making the mechanism fast, and simple. The climbing mechanism was our most reliable with a 100% in game success rate for games where we chose to climb. It was also a rarity at regional events to see a climbing robot, and was a great achievement for the team that we were able to build such a reliable mechanism.

## Drive Base: Swerve Drive

- **Compact Modules**  
  Smaller footprint and easier maintenance with top-mounted steering gears.  
- **775pro Motors**  
  Swapped miniCIMs for 775pros and derated voltage to prevent burnout.  
- **Field Agility**  
  Enabled rapid direction changes and defensive positioning.
