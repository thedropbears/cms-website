## Overview

The 2023 FIRST Robotics Competition game **Charged Up** challenged teams to collect and score both cones and inflatable cubes while balancing robot battery charge. **Lenny Grabitz**, designed through intensive prototyping and student-led innovation, leveraged vision processing and robust mechanical systems to excel in cube handling and automated scoring.

## Key Features & Innovations

- **AprilTag-Assisted Localization**  
  Dual-camera vision system detected field AprilTags to correct drivetrain odometry and maintain sub-inch positional accuracy for precise cube pickup and scoring.

- **Automated Cube Grasping**  
  Break-beam and limit-switch sensors integrated into the end effector enabled hands-free detection and secure gripping of cubes, reducing driver workload.

- **Extendable Scoring Arm**  
  Telescoping arm mechanism allowed mid-to-high goal scoring without chassis repositioning, ensuring swift cycle times and improved shot consistency.

## End Effector Mechanism  

The four-bar claw actuated by a linear pneumatic piston offered both strength and compliance. Iterative prototypes refined jaw geometry to handle cubes securely. Embedded break-beam sensors signaled when a cube was fully seated, triggering autonomous transport routines.

## Intake Mechanism  

An over-bumper roller intake drew cubes into the robot swiftly. Inspired by the 2022 design but pared down for weight savings, two compliant rollers and a pneumatic deploy system provided reliable acquisition under varying match conditions.

## Arm Rotation & Extension

- **Rotation:** Dual NEO motors with custom gearboxes drove the arm through belt-and-sprocket linkages, enabling 180° of motion within frame perimeter.
- **Extension:** A NEO 550-powered rope-and-pulley system telescoped the arm 0.6 m to reach mid and high nodes automatically, based on vision-guided targeting.

## Competition Results

### Southern Cross Regional (Wollongong)  

- **Alliance Finish:** 3rd Place  
- **Alliance Partners:** Koalified (6996), Embers (7583)  
- **Performance Highlight:** After early drivetrain belt failures, the pit crew’s rapid switch to chain drives enabled Lenny Grabitz to climb from 35th in qualifications to 8th, securing the 1st pick of the 4th alliance and ultimately a podium finish.
