## Key Features & Innovations

- **Advanced Autonomous Targeting**  
  By fusing retroreflective goal-ring sensors with drivetrain odometry, the robot’s control software continuously estimated its field position and velocity. The turret system then automatically aimed and compensated for robot motion, enabling accurate shots while moving.

- **Smart Ball Handling**  
  Break-beam and color sensors in the intake and indexer detected and rejected out-of-color balls on the fly, ensuring only alliance-legal game pieces reached the shooter.

- **High-Capacity Autonomous Routine**  
  A tailored autonomous program scored **five balls** in the first 15 seconds, leveraging precise positioning and rapid indexing.

## Shooter & Turret Mechanisms

### Shooter Assembly

- Dual flywheel system launches balls 3–12 m into the upper goal.
- Added triple back-rollers for increased range, consistency, and reduced backspin.
- Onshape renders guided initial geometry and stress analysis.

### Turret Assembly

- Slewing ring feed into the shooter, powered by a custom-machined gear.
- Offers **380°+** rotation for unlimited firing angles.
- Integrates seamlessly with the autonomous targeting subsystem.

## Intake & Indexing Mechanisms

- **Tiered Roller Intake**  
  Spinning roller prototypes captured balls reliably; the final design balanced compactness with compliance for smooth acquisition.
- **Inline Indexer**  
  Wheels-controlled staging held up to five balls and fed them into the shooter. Alternate use as an opponent-ball trap was explored but ultimately set aside for capacity.

Challenges with piston placement and air flow were solved by adding extra storage and redesigned brackets, boosting intake speed and reliability.

## Climbing Mechanism

A last-minute climbing winch and hook system was prototyped and bench-tested. Although deemed reliable, it was removed before competition to prioritize shooting performance, reflecting the team’s strategic focus.
