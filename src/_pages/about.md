# About Us

## About the Drop Bears

We are a team of high school students, sharing our passion for STEM. Split into sub-teams and with support from our industry-skilled mentors, we compete in the worldwide, annual FIRST Robotics Competition.

Our team is based at USYD in Sydney, Australia.

## SubTeams

### Mechanical

The Mechanical Team is charged with the nuts and bolts of engineering the robot.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Design, and draw plans for engineering
- Test designs both physically and theoretically
- Physically construct the robot
- Provide ongoing maintenance of the robot

Students learn to use programs such as Onshape, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package and develop skills within engineering mechanics to solve problems and design solutions.

### Controls

In charge of controlling the robot and making it intelligent.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Vision, using cameras to provide the robot with useful information.
- Autonomous, giving the robot predetermined actions.
- Dashboard, provide the robot drivers with useful information about the robot.

Software students will be taught, over the course of the season:

- Programming in Python.
- Problem solving.
- Collaboration with other team members.
