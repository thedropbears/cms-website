## Subteams

### Mechanical

The Mechanical Team is charged with the nuts and bolts of engineering the robot.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Design, and draw plans for engineering
- Test designs both physically and theoretically
- Physically construct the robot
- Provide ongoing maintenance of the robot

Students learn to use programs such as Onshape, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package and develop skills within engineering mechanics to solve problems and design solutions.

### Controls

In charge of controlling the robot and making it intelligent.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Vision, using cameras to provide the robot with useful information.
- Autonomous, giving the robot predetermined actions.
- Dashboard, provide the robot drivers with useful information about the robot.

Software students will be taught, over the course of the season:

- Programming in Python.
- Problem solving.
- Collaboration with other team members.

## What is FRC?

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a high school robotics competition that is held annually. It combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. FRC is designed to help students explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to develop real-world skills for the future.

## What is Build Season?

Build season starts around early January and finishes around the end of February. During this time, the team designs and builds the robot for the upcoming competition, which is usually in mid-March.

## What is Off Season?

Off-season is before build season. During the off-season, we recruit and teach rookies the skills they will need, and we work on long-term projects like getting sponsors and recruitment.
