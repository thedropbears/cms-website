## About us

We are a team of high school students, sharing our passion for STEM. Split into sub-teams and with support from our industry-skilled mentors, we compete in the worldwide, annual [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

Our team is based at USYD in Sydney, Australia.

## Subteams

### Mechanical

<img src="/static/img/mechanical.png" alt="Mechanical assembly work" class="w-full md:w-1/3 md:float-right md:ml-6 mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">

The Mechanical Team is charged with the nuts and bolts of engineering the robot.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Design, and draw plans for engineering
- Test designs both physically and theoretically
- Physically construct the robot
- Provide ongoing maintenance of the robot

Students learn to use programs such as Onshape, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package and develop skills within engineering mechanics to solve problems and design solutions.

### Controls


In charge of controlling the robot and making it intelligent.

It provides the opportunity for students to:

- Vision, using cameras to provide the robot with useful information.
- Autonomous, giving the robot predetermined actions.
- Dashboard, provide the robot drivers with useful information about the robot.

Software students will be taught, over the course of the season:

- Programming in Python.
- Problem solving.
- Collaboration with other team members.

## Mentors

Our team is supported by a group of experienced and enthusiastic industry-skilled mentors. Our mentors are the backbone of the team and encapsulate a mix of professional engineers, students who have previously competed in FRC and professionals from multidisciplinary backgrounds working in industry. Led by the head mentor, they assist with identifying tasks and teaching students how to strategise, design, build and code robots.

### Head Mentors

## What is FRC?

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a global high school robotics competition that is held annually. It combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. FRC is designed to help students explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to develop real-world skills for the future.

## What is Build Season?

Build season starts around early January and finishes around the end of February. During this time, the team meets 5 days each week to design and build the robot for the regional competition, which takes place in Sydney during mid-March.

## What is Off Season?

Off-season is the period after the local regional competition before build season. During the off-season, we work on our current robot to improve our skills and knowledge, usually take part in off-season competitions, which are sometimes inter-State, and work on longer-term projects including sponsorship and recruitment. In some years we have travelled to international competitions in Canada or the USA after the regional finals
